Implements classification algorithms to accurately predict diabetes presence.

Evaluates model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

Provides clear insights into feature importance.

Easy-to-run Python scripts with modular, well-documented code.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes multiple patient health attributes such as:

Number of pregnancies

Glucose levels

Blood pressure

Skin thickness

Insulin levels

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Diabetes pedigree function

Age

The dataset is sourced from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

🛠️ Technologies Used
